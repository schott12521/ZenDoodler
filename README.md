We built this at BitCamp 2016 to mimic this: http://i.imgur.com/GO22Mqr.gifv

Our 'finished' product can be seen here: https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~slanoue/

The project: We spent roughly 24 hours working on the concept. We had to figure out the math behind how the square were generated,
and that was grueling. Also, we got tired eventually and hungry, so we had to sleep.
